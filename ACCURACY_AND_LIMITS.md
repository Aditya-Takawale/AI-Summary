## 🎥 Video Length & Size Limits

### Video File Size
**No Hard Limit!**  The application processes:
1. Audio extraction (works with any video size)
2. Transcription (works with audio of any length)
3. Analysis (depends on transcription length)

### Practical Limits

#### Audio Extraction
- ✅ **Limit**: None (moviepy handles any video size)
- ⚠️ **Note**: Larger files take longer to process
- 💾 **Disk Space**: Needs temp space for audio file (typically ~1/10 of video size)

#### Transcription (Whisper)
- ✅ **Recommended**: Up to 2-3 hours per video
- ⚠️ **Processing Time**: 
  - `tiny` model: ~1-2 minutes per hour of audio
  - `base` model: ~3-5 minutes per hour of audio
  - `small` model: ~5-10 minutes per hour of audio
  - `medium` model: ~10-20 minutes per hour of audio
  - `large` model: ~20-40 minutes per hour of audio
- 💾 **RAM Requirements**:
  - `tiny`/`base`: 1-2 GB
  - `small`: 2-4 GB
  - `medium`: 4-6 GB
  - `large`: 8-12 GB

#### LLM Analysis (Ollama - llama3.1)
- ✅ **Recommended**: Up to ~15,000 characters (~3,000 words)
- ⚠️ **Context Limit**: llama3.1 has ~8K token context window
- **Your Test Results**:
  - Video 1: 4,799 characters ✅
  - Video 2: 5,755 characters ✅
  - Video 3: 4,586 characters ✅

**For Longer Videos (>2 hours):**
- Option 1: Split video into chunks
- Option 2: Use larger context models (`llama3.1:70b`, `gemma2:27b`)
- Option 3: Process full transcription but summarize in chunks

### Performance Benchmarks

| Video Length | Whisper (base) | Ollama Analysis | Total Time |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| 5 minutes    | 30-60 sec      | 20-40 sec       | ~1-2 min   |
| 15 minutes   | 1-3 min        | 30-60 sec       | ~2-4 min   |
| 30 minutes   | 3-5 min        | 40-80 sec       | ~4-7 min   |
| 1 hour       | 5-10 min       | 60-120 sec      | ~7-12 min  |
| 2 hours      | 10-20 min      | 90-180 sec      | ~12-25 min |

*Note: Times vary based on your CPU/GPU performance*

### Recommended Workflow

#### For Short Videos (<30 minutes)
```powershell
python main.py video.mp4 --word --summary-only
```
- Fast processing
- All features work optimally

#### For Medium Videos (30 min - 2 hours)
```powershell
python main.py video.mp4 --word -m small
```
- Use `small` model for better accuracy
- Still reasonable processing time

#### For Long Videos (2+ hours)
**Option 1: Use faster models**
```powershell
python main.py video.mp4 --word -m tiny
```

**Option 2: Split the video first**
Use video editing software or ffmpeg to split into chunks:
```powershell
# Example with ffmpeg (if installed)
ffmpeg -i long_video.mp4 -t 01:30:00 -c copy part1.mp4
ffmpeg -ss 01:30:00 -i long_video.mp4 -c copy part2.mp4
```
